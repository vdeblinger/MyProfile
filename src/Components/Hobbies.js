            <h4>Writing</h4>
            <p>Singing emplored me to express emotions through song. I wanted to take another step in expression through writing. First, my writting was simple poems and entries in my journal. Then, I began furthering my writting through fiction, as well as, writing a memoir. Sadly, I have not completed any stories to its entirety. I still do so in my free time though, so it is not a dead hobby by any means</p>
            <h4>Gaming</h4>
            <p>Games have been a part of my life since childhood. I grew up along side the development of consoles, internet/computer, and cell phones. Truly incredible how far technology has come. Throughout the advancements, I fascinated on how this digital world worked. Within the last decade, I grew more and more interested in gaming and computers. I did my best to become a "good" gamer, and tried to take in all the information I could learn about computers while I took my gaming to the next level with PC. </p>
